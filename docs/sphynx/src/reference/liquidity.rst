Liquidity Reference
===================

Contract Format
---------------

All the contracts have the following form::

 [%%version 0.3]
 
 <... local declarations ...>
 
 let%init storage
     (x : TYPE)
     (x : TYPE)
     ... =
     BODY
 
 let%entry main
     (parameter : TYPE)
     (storage : TYPE) =
     BODY


The ``version`` statement tells the compiler in which version of
Liquidity the contract is written. The compiler will reject any
contract that has a version that it does not understand (too old, more
recent). We expect to reach version 1.0 at the launch of the Tezos
network.

The ``main`` function is the default entry point for the contract.
``let%entry`` is the construct used to declare entry points (there is
currently only one entry point, but there will be probably more in the
future).  The declaration takes two parameters with names
``parameter``, ``storage``, the arguments to the function. Their types must
always be specified. The return type of the function must also be
specified by a type annotation.

A contract always returns a pair ``(operations, storage)``, where
``operations`` is a list of internal operations to perform after
exectution of the contract, and ``storage`` is the final state of the
contract after the call. The type of the pair must match the type of a
pair where the first component is a list of opertations and the second
is the type of the argument ``storage`` of ``main``.

``<... local declarations ...>`` is an optional set of optional type and
function declarations. Type declarations can be used to define records
and variants (sum-types), described later in this documentation.

An optional initial storage or storage initializer can be given with
``let%init storage``. When deploying a Liquidity contract, if the
storage is not constant it is evaluated in the prevalidation context.

Basic Types and Values
----------------------

Types in Liquidity are monomorphic. They are all inherited from
Michelson, except for algebraic data types and records, that are
translated to Michelson types.

Basic Types
~~~~~~~~~~~

The built-in base types are:

- ``unit``: whose only constructor is ``()``
- ``bool``: Booleans
- ``int``: Unbounded integers
- ``nat``: Unbounded naturals (positive integers)
- ``tez``: The type of amounts
- ``string``: character strings
- ``bytes``: bytes sequences
- ``timestamp``: dates and timestamps
- ``key``: cryptographic keys
- ``key_hash``: hashes of cryptographic keys
- ``signature``: cryptographic signatures
- ``operation``: type of operations, can only be constructed
- ``address``: abstract type of contract addresses

Composite Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
Types can be composed using the following type operators:

- tuples: noted ``t1 * t2``, ``t1 * t2 * t3``, etc.
- functions: ``'a -> 'b`` is the type of functions from ``'a`` to
  ``'b``, equivalent to ``('a, 'b) lambda``.

and the following predefined combinators:
  
- lists: ``'a list`` is the type of lists of elements in ``'a``
- sets: ``'a set`` is the type of sets of elements in ``'a``
- maps: ``('a, 'b) map`` is the type of maps whose keys are of type
  ``'a`` and values of type ``'b``;
- big maps: ``('a, 'b) big_map`` is the type of lazily deserialized maps whose
  keys are of type ``'a`` and values of type ``'b``;
- contracts: ``'a contract`` for contracts whose parameter is of type ``'a``;
  
and the predefined algebraic data types:

- option type: ``'a option = None | Some of 'a``
- variant type: ``('a, 'b) variant = Left of 'a | Right of 'b``

Record and variant types must be declared beforehand and are referred
to by their names.


Constants Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The unique constructor of type ``unit`` is ``()``.

The two Booleans (``bool``) constants are:

* ``true``
* ``false``

As in Michelson, there are different types of integers:

* ``int`` : an unbounded integer, positive or negative, simply written ``0``,``1``,``2``,``-1``,``-2``,...
* ``nat`` : an unbounded positive integer, written either with a ``p`` suffix (``0p``, ``12p``, etc.) or as an integer with a type coercion ( ``(0 : nat)`` ).
* ``tez`` : an unbounded positive float of Tezzies, written either with a ``tz`` suffix (``1.00tz``, etc.) or as a string with type coercion (``("1.00" : tez)``).

Strings (``string``) are delimited by the characters ``"`` and ``"``.

Bytes (``bytes``) are sequences of hexadecimal pairs preceeded by ``0x``, for
instance:

* ``0x``
* ``0xabcdef``

Timestamps (``timestamp``) are written in ISO 8601 format, like in Michelson:

* ``2015-12-01T10:01:00+01:00``

Keys, key hashes and signatures are base58-check encoded, the same as in Michelson:

* ``tz1YLtLqD1fWHthSVHPD116oYvsd4PTAHUoc`` is a key hash (``key_hash``)
* ``edpkuit3FiCUhd6pmqf9ztUTdUs1isMTbF9RBGfwKk1ZrdTmeP9ypN`` is a public
  key (``key``)
*
  ``edsigedsigthTzJ8X7MPmNeEwybRAvdxS1pupqcM5Mk4uCuyZAe7uEk68YpuGDeViW8wSXMr
  Ci5CwoNgqs8V2w8ayB5dMJzrYCHhD8C7`` is a signature (``signature``)

There are also three types of collections: lists, sets and
maps. Constants collections can be created directly:

* Lists: ``["x"; "y"]`` for a ``string list``;
* Sets: ``Set [1; 2; 3; 4]`` for an ``int set``;
* Maps: ``Map [1, "x"; 2, "y"; 3, "z"]`` for a ``(int, string) map``;
* Big maps: ``BigMap [1, "x"; 2, "y"; 3, "z"]`` for a ``(int, string) big_map``

In the case of an empty collection, whose type cannot be inferred, the type must be specified:

* Lists: ``([] : int list)``
* Sets: ``(Set : int set)``
* Maps: ``(Map : (int, string) map)``
* Big maps: ``(BigMap : (int, string) big_map)``

Options (``option``) can be defined with:

* An empty option: ``(None : int option)``
* A valued option: ``Some 3``

Variants (``variant``) can be defined with:

* Left alternative: ``Left "hello"``
* Right alternative: ``Right 3``

for a ``(string, int) variant``.

The ``variant`` type is not supposed to be used by programmers, who
can defined their own algebraic data types. Instead, ``variant`` is
used when decompiling Michelson code.

It is also possible to coerce some constants between their inferred
type and another compatible type, using the notation
``( CONSTANT : NEWTYPE )``:

* A ``string`` can be coerced to ``tez`` (the string must contain an
  integer in mutez Ã  la Michelson), ``timestamp``, ``key``,
  ``address``, ``_ contract``, ``key_hash`` and ``signature``.
* A ``bytes`` can be coerced to ``address``, ``_ contract``, ``key``,
   ``key_hash`` and ``signature``.
* An ``address`` can be coerced to ``_ contract``.
* A ``_ contract`` can be coerced to ``address``.
* A ``key_hash`` can be coerced to ``unit contract`` and ``address``.


Predefined Primitives
---------------------

There are two kinds of primitives in the language:

* **Prefix primitives** are used by putting the primitive before the
  arguments: ``prim x y z``. All alphanumerical primitives are prefix
  primitives, except ``lor``, ``lxor``, ``mod``, ``land``, ``lsl``,
  ``lsr`` and ``asr``.
* **Infix primitves** are used by putting the primitive between the
  arguments: ``x prim y``. Infix primitives are always operators
  (``+``, ``-``, etc.).

When the type of a primitive is specified, we extend the notation for
functions like this:

* ``TYPE_ARG -> TYPE_RESULT`` for a primitive with one argument
* ``TYPE_ARG1 -> TYPE_ARG2 -> TYPE_RESULT`` for a primitive with two arguments

Whereas functions can only take one argument in Liquidity/Michelson
(possibly a tuple), primitives can take multiple arguments.

Comparison between values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All the values are not comparable. Only two values of the following
types can be compared with each other:

* ``bool``
* ``int``
* ``nat``
* ``tez``
* ``string``
* ``bytes``
* ``timestamp``
* ``key_hash``
* ``address``

The following comparison operators are available:

* ``=`` : equal
* ``<>`` : not-equal
* ``<`` : strictly less
* ``<=`` : less or equal
* ``>`` : strictly more
* ``>=`` : more or equal

There is also a function ``compare x y`` to compare two values and return
an integer, as follows:

* returns 0 if ``x`` and ``y`` are equal
* returns a strictly positive integer if ``x > y``
* returns a strictly negative integer if ``x < y``

The ``Current`` module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``Current.balance: unit -> tez``: returns the balance of the current
  contract. The balance contains the amount of tez that was sent by
  the current operation. It is translated to ``BALANCE`` in Michelson.

  Example::

    let bal = Current.balance() in
    ...
    
* ``Current.time: unit -> timestamp``: returns the timestamp of the
  block in which the transaction is included. This value is chosen by
  the baker that is including the transaction, so it should not be
  used as a reliable source of alea.  It is translated to ``NOW`` in
  Michelson.

  Example::
    
    let now = Current.time () in
    ...
    
* ``Current.amount: unit -> tez``: returns the amount of tez
  transferred by the current operation (standard or internal
  transaction). It is translated to ``AMOUNT`` in Michelson.

  Example::

    let received = Current.amount() in
    ...
    
* ``Current.gas: unit -> nat``: returns the amount of gas available to
  execute the rest of the transaction. It is translated to
  ``STEPS_TO_QUOTA`` in Michelson.

  Example::

    let remaining_gas = Current.gas () in
    if remaining_gas < 1000p then
      Current.failwith ("not enough gas", remaining_gas);
    ...
  
* ``Current.source: unit -> address``: returns the address that
  initiated the current transaction in the blockchain. It is the same
  one for all the operations in the transaction, standard and
  internal. It is the address that paid the fees and storage cost, and
  signed the operation on the blockchain. It is translated to
  ``SOURCE`` in Michelson.

  Example::

    let addr = Current.source () in
    ...
    
* ``Current.sender: unit -> address``: returns the address that
  initiated the current operation. It is the same as the source for
  the toplevel operation, but it is the originating contract for
  internal operations. It is translated to ``SENDER`` in Michelson.

  Example::

    let addr = Current.sender () in
    ...
    
* ``failwith`` or ``Current.failwith: 'a -> 'b``: makes the current
  transaction and all its internal transactions fail. No modification
  is done to the context. The argument can be any value (often a
  string and some argument), the system will display it to explain why
  the transaction failed.

  Example::

    let remaining_gas = Current.gas () in
    if remaining_gas < 1000p then
      Current.failwith ("not enough gas", remaining_gas);
    ...
  
Operations on tuples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``get t n``, ``Array.get t n`` and ``t.(n)`` where ``n`` is a
  constant positive-or-nul int: returns the ``n``-th element of the
  tuple ``t``. Tuples are translated to Michelson by pairing on the
  right, i.e. ``(a,b,c,d)`` becomes ``(a, (b, (c,d)))``. In this
  example, ``a`` is the ``0``-th element.

  Example::

    let x = (1,2,3,4) in
    let car = x.(0) in
    let cdr = x.(1) in
    if car <> 1 || car <> 2 then Current.failwith "Error !";
  
* ``set t n x``, ``Array.set t n x`` and ``t.(n) <- x`` where ``n`` is
  constant positive-or-nul int: returns the tuple where the ``n``-th element
  has been replaced by ``x``.

  Example::

    let x = (1,2,3,4) in
    let x0 = x.(0) <- 10 in
    let x1 = x0.(1) <- 11 in
    if x1 <> (10,11,3,4) then Current.failwith "Error !";

  
Operations on numeric values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``+``: Addition. With the following types:
  
  * ``tez -> tez -> tez``
  * ``nat -> nat -> nat``
  * ``int|nat -> int|nat -> int``
  * ``timestamp -> int|nat -> timestamp``
  * ``int|nat -> timestamp -> timestamp``
    
    It is translated to ``ADD`` in Michelson.
    
* ``-``: Substraction. With the following types:
  
  * ``tez -> tez -> tez``
  * ``int|nat -> int|nat -> int``
  * ``timestamp -> int|nat -> timestamp``
  * ``timestamp -> timestamp -> int``
  * ``int|nat -> int`` (negation)
  
    It is translated to ``SUB`` in Michelson.

* ``*``: Multiplication. With the following types:

  * ``nat -> tez -> tez``
  * ``tez -> nat -> tez``
  * ``nat -> nat -> nat``
  * ``nat|int -> nat|int -> int``

    It is translated to ``MUL`` in Michelson.

    Example::

      (* conversion from nat to tez *)
      let v = 1000p in
      let amount = v * 1tz in
      ...

* ``/``: Euclidian division. With the following types:

  * ``nat -> nat -> ( nat * nat ) option``
  * ``int|nat -> int|nat -> ( int *  nat ) option``
  * ``tez -> nat -> ( tez * tez ) option``
  * ``tez -> tez -> ( nat * tez ) option``
  
    It is translated to ``EDIV`` in Michelson.

    Example::

      (* conversion from tez to nat *)
      let v = 1000tz in
      let (nat, rem_tez) = v / 1tz in
      ...
    
* ``~-``: Negation. Type: ``int|nat -> int``
  
    It is translated to ``NEG`` in Michelson.
  
* ``lor``, ``or`` and ``||``: OR with the following types:

  * ``bool -> bool -> bool``
  * ``nat -> nat -> nat``
  
    It is translated to ``OR`` in Michelson.
    
* ``&``, ``land`` and ``&&``: AND with the following types:

  * ``bool -> bool -> bool``
  * ``nat|int -> nat -> nat``
  
    It is translated to ``AND`` in Michelson.

* ``lxor``, ``xor``: Exclusive OR with the following types:

  * ``bool -> bool -> bool``
  * ``nat -> nat -> nat``
  
    It is translated to ``XOR`` in Michelson.
    
* ``not``: NOT

  * ``bool -> bool``
  * ``nat|int -> int`` (two-complement with sign negation)

    It is translated to ``NOT`` in Michelson.

* ``abs``: Absolute value. Type ``int -> int``

    It is translated to ``ABS`` in Michelson.

* ``is_nat``: Maybe positive. Type ``int -> nat option``. It is
  translated to ``IS_NAT`` in Michelson.

    Instead of using ``is_nat``, it is recommended to use a specific form
    of pattern matching::

      match%nat x with
      | Plus x -> ...
      | Minus x -> ...

* ``int``: To integer. Type ``nat -> int``

    It is translated to ``INT`` in Michelson.

* ``>>`` and ``lsr`` : Logical shift right. Type ``nat -> nat -> nat``

    It is translated to ``LSR`` in Michelson.

* ``<<`` and ``lsl`` : Logical shift left. Type ``nat -> nat -> nat``

    It is translated to ``LSL`` in Michelson.


Operations on contracts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``Contract.call: 'a contract -> tez -> 'a -> operation``. Forge an
  internal transaction. It is translated to ``TRANSFER_TOKENS`` in
  Michelson.

  Example::

    let contract =  (tz1... : unit contract) in
    let op = Contract.call contract 1000tz () in
    ...
    ([op], storage)
  
* ``Account.create: key_hash -> key_hash option -> bool -> tez ->
  operation * address``. Forge an operation to create a new
  (originated) account and returns its address. It is translated to
  ``CREATE_ACCOUNT`` in Michelson.

  Example::

    let not_delegatable = false in
    let (op, addr) =
      Account.create manager (Some delegate) not_delegatable 100tz
    in
    ...
    ([op], storage)
  
* ``Account.default: key_hash -> unit contract``. Returns the contract
  associated to the given ``key_hash``. Since this contract is not
  originated, it cannot contains code, so transfers to it cannot
  fail. It is translated to ``IMPLICIT_ACCOUNT`` in Michelson.

  Example::

    let key = edpk... in
    let key_hash = Crypto.hash_key key in
    let contract = Account.default key_hash in
    ...
  
* ``Contract.set_delegate: key_hash option -> operation``. Forge a
  delegation operation for the current contract. A ``None`` argument
  means that the contract should have no delegate (it falls back to
  its manager). The delegation operation will only be executed in an
  internal operation if it is returned at the end of the ``%entry``
  function. It is translated to ``SET_DELEGATE`` in Michelson.

  Example::

    let op1 = Contract.set_delegate (Some tz1...) in
    let op2 = Contract.set_delegate None in
    ...
    ([op1;op2], storage)
  
* ``Contract.address: _ contract -> address`` . Returns the address of
  a contract. It is translated to ``ADDRESS`` in Michelson.

  Example::

    let addr = Contract.address (Contract.self ()) in
    let map = Map.add addr contract map in
    ...
  
* ``Contract.at: address -> 'a contract option``. Returns the contract
  associated with the address and type annotation, if any. Must be
  annotated with the type of the contract. It is translated to
  ``CREATE_CONTRACT`` in Michelson.

  Example::

    match (Contract.at addr : (bool contract) option) with
    | None -> failwith ("Cannot recover bool contract from:", addr)
    | Some contract -> ...
  
    
* ``Contract.self: unit -> 'a contract``. Returns the current
  executing contract. It is translated to ``SELF`` in Michelson.

  Example::

    let contract = Contract.self () in
    ...
  
* ``Contract.create: key_hash -> key_hash option -> bool -> bool ->
  tez -> 'storage -> ('param -> 'storage -> operation list * 'storage)
  -> (operation, address)``. Forge an operation to originate a
  contract with code. The contract is only created when the operation
  is executed, so it must be returned by the transaction. Note that
  the code must be specified as an inline function with two arguments
  ``parameter`` and ``storage`` with type annotatinons. It is
  translated to ``CREATE_CONTRACT`` in Michelson.


  Example::

    let delegatable = true in
    let spendable = false in
    let contract_storage = (10tz,"Hello") in
    let (op, addr) =
       Contract.create manager (Some delegate) delegatable spendable
         10tz contract_storage
         (fun (parameter:string) (storage: tez * string) ->
         ...)
    in

    (* THIS WILL FAIL UNTIL THE OPERATION IS EXECUTED *)
    let new_contract = (Contract.at addr : string contract option) in
    ...
    ( [op], storage )
    
Cryptographic operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
              
* ``Crypto.blake2b: bytes -> bytes``. Computes the cryptographic hash of
  a bytes with the cryptographic Blake2b function. It is translated to
  ``BLAKE2B`` in Michelson.

  Example::

    let hash = Crypto.blake2b (Bytes.pack map) in
    ...
  
* ``Crypto.sha256: bytes -> bytes``. Computes the cryptographic hash
  of a bytes with the cryptographic Sha256 function. It is translated
  to ``SHA256`` in Michelson.

  Example::

    let hash = Crypto.sha256 (Bytes.pack map) in
    ...
  
* ``Crypto.sha512: bytes -> bytes``. Computes the cryptographic hash of
  a bytes with the cryptographic Sha512 function. It is translated to ``SHA512`` in Michelson.

  Example::

    let hash = Crypto.sha512 (Bytes.pack map) in
    ...

  
* ``Crypto.hash_key: key -> key_hash``. Hash a public key and encode
  the hash in B58check. It is translated to ``HASH_KEY`` in Michelson.

  Example::

    let key_hash = Crypto.hash_key edpk1234... in
    let contract = Account.default key_hash in
    ...

  
* ``Crypto.check: key -> signature -> bytes -> bool``. Check that the
  signature corresponds to signing the sequence of bytes with the
  public key. It is translated to ``CHECK_SIGNATURE`` in Michelson.

  Example::

    let bytes = Crypto.blake2b (Bytes.pack param) in
    if not (Crypto.check key signature bytes) then
      failwith "You are not allowed to do that";
    ...

* ``Set.update: 'a -> bool -> 'a set -> 'a set``. It is translated to ``UPDATE`` in Michelson.
* ``Set.add: 'a -> 'a set -> 'a set``   . It is translated to ``ADD`` in Michelson.

Here is a table of how Michelson instructions translate to Liquidity:

  
* ``ADDRESS``: ``Contract.address addr``
* ``AMOUNT``: ``Current.amount()``
* ``ABS``: ``abs x``

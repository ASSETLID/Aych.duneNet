Welcome to Liquidity's documentation!
=====================================

Liquidity is a high-level statically-typed language to program Smart
Contracts for Tezos. It uses a subset of the syntax of OCaml, and
strictly complies to Michelson security restrictions. It comes with a
decompiler that can translate Michelson contracts to Liquidity, for
auditing purpose.

All the rules are implemented, except:

* Function types.
  * Not done because of conflicts in the grammar. Should be resolved the same
   way as ambiguities on arrays and field accesses;
* Inline Assembly Statements
  * Not done because it is probably too low level for any type of analysis
   aiming at generating Liquidity;
